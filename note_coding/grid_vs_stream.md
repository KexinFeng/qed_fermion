what's the difference between zeros_like and empty_like? which should i use

GitHub Copilot: The difference between `torch::zeros_like` and `torch::empty_like` lies in how they initialize the tensor:

1. **`torch::zeros_like`**:
   - Creates a tensor with the same shape, dtype, and device as the input tensor.
   - Initializes all elements to **zero**.
   - Example:
     ```cpp
     auto out = torch::zeros_like(d_r);
     ```
     This ensures that `out` is initialized to zero, which is useful when you need a clean starting point for computations.

2. **`torch::empty_like`**:
   - Creates a tensor with the same shape, dtype, and device as the input tensor.
   - Does **not initialize** the elements, leaving them with **uninitialized (garbage) values**.
   - Example:
     ```cpp
     auto out = torch::empty_like(d_r);
     ```
     This is faster than `zeros_like` because it skips initialization, but you must explicitly set the values before using the tensor.

### Which should you use?
- Use **`torch::zeros_like`** if you need the tensor to be initialized to zero before use (e.g., for accumulation or computations that assume zero-initialized values).
- Use **`torch::empty_like`** if you will immediately overwrite all elements of the tensor (e.g., in-place operations) and want to save initialization time.

In your case:
```cpp
auto out = torch::zeros_like(d_r);
```
This is appropriate if the kernel or subsequent operations rely on `out` being initialized to zero. If you are certain that every element of `out` will be explicitly set by the kernel, you could switch to `torch::empty_like` for better performance.

KexinFeng: /explain  if grid size is greater than 1 like in this case, how will stream execute the job, in terms of the execution order of blocks within grid and in relationship with other streams?

GitHub.copilot-chat.github.copilot.editor: In CUDA, the execution of blocks within a grid and the relationship with streams is governed by specific rules. Let me break it down for you:

### 1. **Execution Order of Blocks Within a Grid**
   - CUDA does not guarantee a specific execution order for blocks within a grid. The blocks are distributed to the available Streaming Multiprocessors (SMs) on the GPU in a way that maximizes hardware utilization.
   - Blocks are executed independently, and their execution order is determined by the hardware scheduler. Some blocks may start earlier, while others may wait for resources to become available.
   - If the grid size is larger than the number of SMs, some blocks will wait in a queue until resources are freed by previously executed blocks.

### 2. **Execution Order Between Streams**
   - Streams allow you to overlap kernel execution and memory operations. If you launch kernels in different streams, they can execute concurrently, provided there are enough resources (e.g., SMs, memory bandwidth).
   - However, within a single stream, CUDA guarantees that operations are executed in the order they are issued. For example, if you launch multiple kernels in the same stream, they will execute sequentially.
   - In your case, the kernel is launched in `streams[stream_id]`. If other kernels are launched in the same stream, they will execute sequentially with respect to this kernel. If kernels are launched in different streams, they may execute concurrently.

### 3. **Relationship Between Blocks and Streams**
   - Blocks within a grid are independent of streams. The stream determines when the kernel (as a whole) starts execution, but once the kernel is launched, the blocks are scheduled independently by the hardware.
   - If multiple streams are active, the GPU scheduler will interleave work from different streams to maximize utilization. This means blocks from different kernels (in different streams) may execute concurrently.

### Example Scenario
If you have:
- A grid with 128 blocks.
- Two streams (`streams[0]` and `streams[1]`).
- Each stream launches a kernel with a grid of 128 blocks.

The GPU will:
1. Start executing blocks from the kernel in `streams[stream_id]` (e.g., `streams[0]`).
2. If `streams[1]` also launches a kernel, the GPU may interleave blocks from both kernels, depending on resource availability.
3. Within each kernel, the execution order of blocks is not guaranteed.

### Key Takeaways
- **Block execution order within a grid is undefined.**
- **Kernels in the same stream execute sequentially.**
- **Kernels in different streams may execute concurrently.**
- **The GPU scheduler dynamically manages block execution to maximize hardware utilization.**

If you need strict control over execution order, you can use CUDA stream synchronization functions like `cudaStreamSynchronize()` or events (`cudaEventRecord()` and `cudaEventSynchronize()`).

KexinFeng: It seems there is not much difference between putting two blocks within the same grid and putting them into two streams. They are gonna be parallelized anyway. Did i miss anything? what's the difference?

GitHub Copilot: You are correct that both approaches—putting two blocks within the same grid or putting them into two separate streams—can result in parallel execution. However, there are key differences between the two approaches that affect **control, scheduling, and resource utilization**. Here's a breakdown:

---

### 1. **Blocks Within the Same Grid**
   - **Execution Context**: All blocks in the same grid belong to the same kernel launch. The kernel is executed in a single stream (default or specified).
   - **Scheduling**: The GPU scheduler distributes blocks across the available Streaming Multiprocessors (SMs). The blocks execute independently, but their execution is tied to the kernel's stream.
   - **Synchronization**: Blocks within the same grid can synchronize using `__syncthreads()` (within a block) or global memory barriers (e.g., `__threadfence()`), but they cannot synchronize across blocks directly.
   - **Resource Sharing**: All blocks share the same kernel's resources (e.g., shared memory, registers, etc.), which are allocated at the kernel level.

   **Use Case**: This approach is simpler and works well when all blocks are part of the same computation and need to share resources or data.

---

### 2. **Blocks in Separate Streams**
   - **Execution Context**: Blocks in separate streams belong to different kernel launches. Each kernel is associated with its own stream.
   - **Scheduling**: Kernels in different streams can execute concurrently, provided there are enough GPU resources (SMs, memory bandwidth, etc.). The GPU scheduler interleaves work from different streams to maximize utilization.
   - **Synchronization**: Streams are independent by default. You can synchronize streams explicitly using CUDA events (e.g., `cudaEventRecord()` and `cudaStreamWaitEvent()`).
   - **Resource Sharing**: Each kernel launch has its own resource allocation. This can lead to better utilization of GPU resources if the kernels are independent, but it can also cause resource contention if the GPU is oversubscribed.

   **Use Case**: This approach is useful when you have independent tasks that can run concurrently, such as overlapping computation and memory transfers or running multiple independent kernels.

### Key Differences
| **Aspect**                | **Same Grid**                                   | **Separate Streams**                              |
|---------------------------|------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| **Execution Context**      | Single kernel launch, single stream.           | Multiple kernel launches, multiple streams.      |
| **Scheduling**             | Blocks scheduled by the same kernel.           | Kernels scheduled independently by streams.      |
| **Synchronization**        | Implicit within the kernel.                    | Requires explicit synchronization between streams.|
| **Resource Allocation**    | Shared across all blocks in the grid.          | Separate for each kernel launch.                 |
| **Overhead**               | Lower (single kernel launch).                  | Higher (multiple kernel launches).               |
| **Concurrency**            | Limited to the kernel's grid.                  | Can overlap with other streams.                  |

### When to Use Each
- **Same Grid**:
  - Use when the blocks are part of the same computation and need to share resources or data.
  - Simpler to implement and manage.
  - Lower overhead since there is only one kernel launch.

- **Separate Streams**:
  - Use when you have independent tasks that can run concurrently.
  - Useful for overlapping computation and memory transfers or running multiple independent kernels.
  - Provides more control over execution order and concurrency.

---

### In Your Case
In your code, you are using **streams** to distribute the kernel launches:
```cpp
int stream_id = i % NUM_STREAMS;
precon_vec_kernel<<<grid, block, dyn_shared_mem, streams[stream_id]>>>(...);
```
This means:
- Each kernel launch is assigned to a different stream (cyclically).
- The GPU scheduler will interleave work from different streams, allowing for potential concurrency.

If you were to put all blocks in the same grid (without streams), the kernel would execute in a single stream, and the blocks would be scheduled as part of the same kernel. This would simplify the code but might reduce concurrency if you are trying to overlap computation with other tasks (e.g., memory transfers).

---

### Conclusion
The choice between using a single grid or multiple streams depends on your specific use case:
- If the blocks are tightly coupled and part of the same computation, use a single grid.
- If you need to overlap independent tasks or maximize concurrency, use multiple streams.

KexinFeng: If i use only one stream and feed into a very large grid of blocks, will the parallelization degree be limited compared to using say 32 streams and evenly partition the blocks into the streams?

GitHub Copilot: No, the degree of parallelization will **not necessarily be limited** if you use a single stream with a very large grid of blocks compared to using multiple streams. Here's why:

### 1. **Single Stream with a Large Grid**
   - When you launch a kernel with a large grid of blocks in a single stream, the GPU scheduler will distribute the blocks across all available **Streaming Multiprocessors (SMs)**.
   - The GPU hardware is designed to maximize parallelism by scheduling as many blocks as possible on the available SMs, subject to resource constraints (e.g., shared memory, registers, etc.).
   - As long as the grid size is large enough to saturate the GPU's resources, the degree of parallelism will be maximized, even with a single stream.

### 2. **Multiple Streams with Partitioned Blocks**
   - When you use multiple streams and partition the blocks across them, the GPU scheduler will interleave work from different streams. This can help overlap **independent tasks** (e.g., computation and memory transfers) or **different kernels**.
   - However, if all the streams are launching kernels that are part of the same computation (e.g., partitioned blocks of the same kernel), the GPU will still execute the blocks in parallel across the SMs, just as it would with a single stream.
   - The main benefit of multiple streams comes when you have **independent tasks** that can run concurrently, not when you're simply partitioning blocks of the same computation.

### Key Differences
| **Aspect**                | **Single Stream, Large Grid**                  | **Multiple Streams, Partitioned Blocks**         |
|---------------------------|------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| **Parallelism**            | Maximized if the grid size is large enough.    | Same degree of parallelism for the same workload.|
| **Overlapping Tasks**      | Limited to sequential execution of kernels.    | Can overlap independent tasks (e.g., memory transfers). |
| **Control**                | Simpler to manage (single stream).             | More control over task scheduling.               |
| **Overhead**               | Lower (single kernel launch).                  | Higher (multiple kernel launches).               |

### When to Use Multiple Streams
- **Overlapping Independent Tasks**: If you need to overlap computation with memory transfers or run multiple independent kernels, multiple streams are beneficial.
- **Fine-Grained Control**: If you need precise control over the execution order of different tasks, multiple streams can help.

### When a Single Stream is Sufficient
- **Single Large Kernel**: If your workload is a single large kernel with enough blocks to saturate the GPU, a single stream is sufficient.
- **No Overlapping Tasks**: If there are no independent tasks to overlap, using multiple streams adds unnecessary complexity.

### In Your Case
In your code, you are using 32 streams and partitioning the blocks across them:
```cpp
int stream_id = i % NUM_STREAMS;
precon_vec_kernel<<<grid, block, dyn_shared_mem, streams[stream_id]>>>(...);
```
If the kernel is part of a single computation and there are no independent tasks to overlap, using multiple streams may not provide any additional benefit. A single stream with a large grid of blocks would likely achieve the same degree of parallelism.

However, if you have other tasks (e.g., memory transfers or other kernels) that can run concurrently, using multiple streams can help overlap those tasks and improve overall GPU utilization.
